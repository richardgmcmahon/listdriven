This is my listdriven (aka forced) photometry resources repo. 

Currently it is focussed on batch processing of near IR images from
the VISTA and WFAM surveys and is heavily dependent on other personal
resources.  The material here is primarily intended for collaborators
and hence no support is provided. The scripts were intially developed
for BOSS target quasar selection using UKIDSS data but also supports
VISTA data.

In future support for WISE, DES and VST survey data will be added. 
The photometry currently uses the CASU (casu.ast.cam.ac.uk) imcore_list 
program (http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/surveys-projects/software-release/imcore)
but support for other photometry packages such as Sextractor is 
planned.
