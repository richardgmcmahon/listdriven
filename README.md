This is my listdriven (aka forced) photometry resources repo. 

Currently it is focussed on batch processing of near IR images from the 
VISTA and WFAM surveys and is heavily dependent on other personal resources. 
The material here is primarily intended from active collaborators and hence 
no support is provided. The script was intially developed for BOSS target 
quasar selection using UKIDSS data but alsosupports VISTA data. 

In future support for WISE, DES and VST survey data will be added. 
The photometry currently uses the CASU (casu.ast.cam.ac.uk) imcore_list 
program (http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/surveys-projects/software-release/imcore)
but support for other photometry packages such as Sextractor is 
planned.
